   A. when the band width is very low, can indicate that price will breakout sooner than later;
     i. MA is in an UP or DOWN market
     ii. check for narrow bollinger band width ; less than the most previous narrow band width
     iii. close is outside of band, and previous swing high/low is inside the band

   B. when the band width is very high (high volatility); can mean that the trend is ending soon; can i. change direction or ii. consolidate
     i. MA is in a sideways (choppy) market -> check if many closes that are abouve or below the bollinger band
     ii. check for a wide bollinger band width ; greater than the most previous wide band
     iii. RSI Divergence; i. price makes a higher high and ii. rsi devergence makes a lower high iii. and divergence should happen abouve the overbought line
